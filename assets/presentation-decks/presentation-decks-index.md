## balena (Overview)
These materials and slides are intended to provide an overview of the entire balena ecosystem, and include short talking points on all of the products, services, components, and technologies that make up the entire balena organization.  These have targeted speaking times, to match the time slots provided by most Meetups, Conferences, or Events.  These do not go into specific details and technical deep dives, and are better for providing high-level overview types of talks.

## balenaCloud
These talks and slides are specifically tailored toward presentations covering balenaCloud and making use of the platform, to simplify IoT Device and Fleet Management.  These presentations are also broken down by anticipated talk-time, and because more time allows for more explanation and complexity, we also have labeled these artifacts as “100 Level, 200 Level, or 300 Level” as the level of detail increases with time.

## balenaHub
balenaHub is our new “App Store” for IoT projects, which can easily be installed on devices such as a Raspberry Pi or Jetson.  The experience as a Developer building Apps and making them available to users is captured in these presentations, as well as the other end of the spectrum...users coming along and installing one of those Apps onto their device.  Similar to the balenaCloud presentations, we have varying levels of detail, intended to match the talk time that is provided by Events.

## Build Your First IoT Device with balena
This session is more of a “hands-on” presentation that could be delivered in a classroom with participants following along, or could possibly be taught as a webinar-style and presented as a demonstration of how easy it is to deploy a balena IoT device.  To go through all of the steps included in this workshop, a minimum of 60 minutes would provide the best experience for attendees.  If participants are indeed following along with hardware in-hand and building live, even up to 90 minutes might be needed depending on the level of subject matter experience and number of attendees / size of the classroom.

## Build Your First AI Device with balena
This presentation is similar to the “Build Your First IoT Device with balena” material, but focuses on building a project that targets Edge AI and Machine Learning instead.  This session could be delivered via webinar for a virtual teaching session, or could be delivered in a classroom style setting as well.  To go through all of the steps included in this workshop, a minimum of 60 minutes would provide the best experience for attendees.  If participants are indeed following along with hardware in-hand and building live, even up to 90 minutes might be needed depending on the level of subject matter experience and number of attendees / size of the classroom.

## Scale a Fleet of Devices with balena
These sessions focus on the “Prototype to Production” workflow, and teach attendees how to build fleets of connected devices using balena.  This can be accomplished in one of two ways, either by the traditional balenaCloud platform for private fleets that are managed by the user, or via the new balenaHub, where “Open Fleets” are desired and anyone can join in and bring their own device.  Both of these presentations target a 60 minute event, and are likely less “hands-on” unless attendees have multiple devices at their disposal to build with.
