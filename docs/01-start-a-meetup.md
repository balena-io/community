# Start a meetup

## Introduction

If you are passionate about something, anything at all, chances are you want to meet other people who are equally as excited as you to share your passion and learn from your fellow enthusiasts. If there isn't already a local meetup for you, no matter the subject matter, here are some resources and guides that you might need to get going and start building your community.

### A meetup is defined by the following characteristics:

* It can be either physical or virtual - Because a meetup is often social in nature a meetup would usually be in person (or physical), this allows you to grow a local community based around your chosen topic. However, Covid has taught us that you can run a meetup virtually, or if your audience is too geographically dispersed to attend in person a virtual event can also work.
* It can be either 1-to-many, like a traditional presentation, or an interactive session format fully intended to be a group discussion.  You could invite speakers to talk about a specialist topic to your community, run workshops or other hands-on sessions, or simply have a social meetup with no agenda.
* A meetup would normally last around 1-2 hours
* A meetup is usually free for your community to attend
* Meetups are regularly recurring, whether that's once a month or with longer intervals between.
* Meetups are volunteer run, an organization might sponsor the beer and pizza but the host is usually an impartial volunteer.
* The event is social in nature, not designed to sell any one solution or platform, just an opportunity to share a passion with like-minded individuals


## Checklist to starting your community
 - [ ] **Decide on what to call your meetup**
        Keep it simple, if you are creating an IoT meetup, other meetups around the world are simply called ‘IoT [your Location]’ e.g. IoT London, IoT North
 - [ ] **Create a logo for your community**
        Creating an IoT meetup? Many IoT meetups around the world use a standard logo format, use [our template](https://community.balena.io/assets/start-a-meetup-resources/iot-meetup-logo-guidelines.md) and [Canva](https://www.canva.com/) (free online graphics software) to create yours. 
 - [ ] **Create a virtual space for your community**
        We recommend using [meetup.com](https://www.meetup.com/) if you are creating a local community, if your meetup is going to be virtual and reach a global audience we recommend creating social media pages or a forum to keep in touch with your members outside of your events and using [Eventbrite](https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/) to register members for each event.


## Checklist to run a meetup 
You can find an shortened version of this checklist with just the action items [here](https://community.balena.io/assets/start-a-meetup-resources/meetup-checklist.xlsx).

### Schedule 

- [ ] **Set date & time**
        Pick a time when most of your community is likely to be free, i.e 7pm-9pm local time on a weekday. We also recommend setting the date for the next event to share during the meetup so your members can get the date in their calendars.
- [ ] **Decide on format (speakers / workshop etc) and set schedule for the event**
        If you are looking for an informative or interactive session to get your started, take a look at our [workshop and presentation templates.]() We don't expect or want your meetup to only talk about balena, but we are here to support you and hope that one of our workshops would be a fun session. You can also request a balena team member to speak at your event or for hardware and swag to run one of our sessions by emailing hello@balena.io.
- [ ] **Invite & confirm speakers if necessary**
- [ ] **Decide whether you are going to do any swag giveaways**
- [ ] **Get in touch with balena to add to add your event to their Events Calendar**
        If you are running an IoT meetup, fill out [this form](https://balena.typeform.com/to/Zepuzolm) to let us know about it. We will add it to our Events calendar and promote the event for you to help you find other IoT enthusiasts in your area.

### Venue
- [ ] **Decide on venue (physical or virtual)**
        For a virtual event you need to decide where online you will host your event, this could be Zoom, Google meets, a Discord call, Twitter spaces or other. The venue will depend on the level of openness and accessibility you want your event to have as well as the cost to use a paid platform. If you are running an IoT meetup, contact balena [using this form](https://balena.typeform.com/to/Zepuzolm) to ask to use our Zoom or Google Meet accounts.
- [ ] **Decide whether the event / speakers will be recorded and shared**
        We recommend always recording your event whether you are going to share it with your community or not. This will enable you to keep a record of any misconduct should you ever need it as well as use the content to promote and grow your meetup. 
- [ ] **Organise food & drinks (if a physical event)**

### Visual Assets

- [ ] **Create Newsletter banner**
        For your email banner, social media graphics or event banner, if you don’t have a preferred design software we recommend using [canva](https://www.canva.com/) (free online graphics software), they have tons of pre-made professional templates which you can adjust to use your own colors, font, logos etc.
- [ ] **Create social media graphics**
        Note: the preferred size varies by platform, so make sure to edit your graphics for each platform’s native media size.
- [ ] **Create banner for event on meetup or Eventbrite**
- [ ] **Visual assets for guests to share to let others know about your event**
        Make it as easy as possible for your attendees to let their network know that they came to your meetup, this is the easiest way to grow your community. This is as easy as sharing with them the image files and copy you used to promote the event on your social media.

### Registration

- [ ] **Create an event somewhere your community can register to attend**
        We recommend meetup.com for local meetups, eventbrite for a global meetup, or google forms if you are looking to bootstrap and need a free tool. Use [our copy template](https://community.balena.io/assets/start-a-meetup-resources/eventbrite-copy-template.md) to get your event set up with a list of questions you might want your attendees to answer when they register.

### Promotion Plan 

- [ ] **Share the event in a newsletter announcement**
        If you are just starting a community, you might not have an email list to promote to, but after the first event, make sure you let all your previous attendees know when your next event will be via email. Check out our [email template here.](https://community.balena.io/assets/start-a-meetup-resources/meetup-email-templates.md)
- [ ] **Share on social media**
        If you have created social media accounts (a variation of Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn, Instagram, Youtube Social) you can encourage your community to follow those pages so they will receive updates from you. You can also post on your own social media and encourage your community to share to reach a wider audience and grow your meetup.
- [ ] **Share on forums**
        If you are hosting an IoT meetup, let the balena community know by posting on our [forums](https://forums.balena.io/c/general/49), you can also share the event on [r/iot on reddit.](https://www.reddit.com/r/IOT/)

### Email and Communication 

- [ ] **Registration confirmation email** 
        Platforms like Eventbrite will send an email to confirm registration automatically but if you want to send an additional confirmation email or using a platform which doesn’t send one, [check out our email templates](https://community.balena.io/assets/start-a-meetup-resources/meetup-email-templates.md) to get an idea of what to include. We recommend using Mailchimp, they are free to use when you send fewer than 10,000 emails a month, really easy to set up and automatically include list management features to make sure you are legally and GDPR compliant. You could include an ‘add to calendar’ button in your email [like this open source tool](https://github.com/carlsednaoui/add-to-calendar-buttons) on GitHub which will auto-generate the code needed for you.
- [ ] **Event reminder email in the run up to the event**
        Just in case your community didn’t put the event on their calendars and need a reminder it’s always good practice to send an email reminder. We recommend sending one 1 day before the event. Check out our [email template here.](https://community.balena.io/assets/start-a-meetup-resources/meetup-email-templates.md)

### Post Event

- [ ] **Process giveaways (if the event was virtual and you couldn't share swag on the day)**
        Use [our template spreadsheet](https://community.balena.io/assets/start-a-meetup-resources/template-swag-giveaways.md) to gather the personal information you need to post giveaways and keep track of who has received what.
- [ ] **Email attendees to share information with them** 
        Let your community know how to continue the discussion (a forum or discord link), where to find the recordings of the session, how they could give feedback, suggest or volunteer to deliver a future session etc. [Use our email template here.](https://community.balena.io/assets/start-a-meetup-resources/meetup-email-templates.md)
