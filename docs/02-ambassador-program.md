Congratulations on joining the balena Ambassador team. We have set up the Ambassador Program to recognize and empower community members who have made outstanding contributions to the balena ecosystem. Our goal: to continue building with balena and to inspire our community.

## Onboarding - Step 1 

After you have officially joined the ambassador program you will be invited to the following places which allows us to interact directly with you and the rest of the ambassadors:
* This GitHub repo 
> * This repo contains all the open resources that are openly available to ours and other communities, If there is anything you would like that you don't see here please reach out and if we have it and are able to share we will, and if we don't have it yet we will work to create what you need.
> * As an Ambassador you have been given write access to this GitHub repo, this is a collaborative space so feel free to make edits to the docs that you think will help future ambassadors or add resources that you have used along the way for other ambassadors or community members to use.
* The Private forums group 
> * This is where most of our communications will take place, we will share announcements and news and you are encouraged discuss ideas and issues you have here. There are lots of balena team members in this group, and as a product led platform we love feedback, so feel free to ping someone directly or tell us about an issue you are having and we will escalate it to the right person.
> * As an ambassador your will also have a badge added to your profile so that other users will know you are an ambassador.
* The Ambassadors Google Calendar
> * Here you can find all of the information for upcoming meetups we are hosting and the details for those
> * You will also find regular office hours hosted by our Developer Advocates, if you have an idea for a project or event and want to get some guidance and support, book in a 1-2-1 call with one of us or invite the rest of the ambassadors along.

## Onboarding - Step 2

* Introduce yourself on the forums: login to the forums and check out [this thread](https://forums.balena.io/t/ambassador-intros/267161/16) Say hi, tell everyone a bit about yourself and what you enjoy working on.

* Review the [Ambassador Guidelines](https://forums.balena.io/t/about-the-ambassadors-ambassador-guidelines/249395/3) which is our version of a code of conduct.

* Announce to the world that you are now a balena Ambassador! - In the Assets folder of this repo you can find our official logo, sticker and some social media graphics templates, download whatever you need and add it to your profile, an announcement post or any materials you use or create related to balena. If you would like a signed certificate to prove your membership of the balena Ambassador program please reach out and we will create a unique one for you. 

* Add yourself and a profile to the [get help and support](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/balena-io/community/master/docs/03-get-help-and-support.md) page in this repo so that members of the community working on a specific challenge can reach out to you as a leader in the balena community for support. Share your expertise, interests and what you are willing to help community members with. as well as a way to reach out to you. 

## About the ambassador monthly meetups 
Each month we have a meetup scheduled in the Ambassadors calendar which you will be invited to, these are hosted on google meet and are an opportunity to catch up with the whole team as well as:
* Hear from members of the balena team - what they are working on and the roadmap for their product
* Meet external influencers in the IoT space 
If there is anything you would like to do during these meetups or anyone you would like to join us from the wider balena team or externally, let us know! 

## Ambassador Guidelines

Our mission is to unlock the promise of physical computing by reducing friction for fleet owners. To that end, we will be working hard to ensure that we align our actions with that purpose. These Ambassador Guidelines should give you an idea how to get involved in the community as a leader as well as a few other details about the Ambassador program.

### How to engage with our community as an ambassador:

The balena ecosystem is constantly growing and evolving. As an ambassador, you are already actively involved in the community in one or multiple ways. Maybe you are creating your own projects on balena and blogging about them, evangelising balena online or on social media, creating apps for the Hub, or consistently helping users out on the forums. There are many ways to inspire, guide, and help others within the balena community within the balena community.  For example:

* Build a project or write a tutorial, work with us to post it on our blog, then reply to comments as readers post questions. This shows the community you have expertise and a desire to help!
* In the Forums, if new users post questions in the wrong category, help to politely educate them, attempt to clarify or gather data, and move the post to the proper category.
* Engage with the balena team as we develop new features, provide feedback on new or existing functionality, and generally use the product to gain subject matter expertise.
* Give talks at meetups or events that demo or make use of balena.  When the world is ready for in-person events, we can make sure you have stickers and swag for attendees.
* Contribute to balena development in GitHub by submitting issues, PR’s, patches, or reply to users with possible solutions in GitHub.
Use your social media presence and following to amplify balena and  grow the balena community.

### Your continued involvement in the ambassador program: 

The balena Ambassador Program is designed to recognise community members who are making outstanding contributions to the balena ecosystem, and encourage and reward developers who participate and evangelize balena to their audiences. Because of the nature of the balena ecosystem, there are so many ways for an ambassador to contribute, so we don’t have a minimum requirement of activity during the programme, all we ask is that you get involved and remain passionate about balena! 

We know that over time priorities change and you may not wish to continue or have time to continue participating in this program. For this reason, we ask all ambassadors to re-apply every two years, to reaffirm your commitment and prevent the program from becoming stale.Don’t worry, you don’t have to keep track of the two year-cycles; we will be in touch with more information on how this will work when it’s time.
