# Start a meetup

## Introduction

If you are passionate about something, anything at all, chances are you want to meet other people who are equally as excited as you to share your passion and learn from your fellow enthusiasts. If there isn't already a local meetup for you, no matter the subject matter, here are some resources and guides that you might need to get going and start building your community.

### A meetup is defined by the following characteristics:

* It can be either physical or virtual - Because a meetup is often social in nature a meetup would usually be in person (or physical), this allows you to grow a local community based around your chosen topic. However, covid has taught us tha you can run a meetup virtually, or if your audience is too geographically dispersed to attend in person a virtual can also work.
* It can be either 1-to-many or an interactive session in format - You could invite speakers to talk about a specialist topic to your community, run workshops or other hands on sessions, or simply have a social meetup with no agenda.
* A meetup would normally last around 1-2 hours
* A meetup is usually free for your community to attend
* Meetups are regularly recurring, whether thats once a month or with longer intervals between.
* Meetups are volunteer run, an organisation might sponsor the beer and pizza but the host is usually an impatial volunteer.
* The event is social in nature, not designed to sell any one solution or platform, just an opportunity to share a passion with likeminded individuals

### Things to think about 

## Schedule 
* Pick a time when most of your community is likely to be free, i.e 7pm-9pm local time on a weekday night.
* If you are looking for an informative or interactive session to get your started, take a look at our workshop and presentation templates. We don't expect or want your meetup to only talk about balena, but we are here to support you and hope that one of our workshops would be a fun session. You can also request a balena team member to speak at your event or for hardware and swag to run one of our sessions by emailing hello@balena.io
* If you are running an IoT meetup, fill out [this form]() to let us know about it, we will add it to our events calendar and promote the event for you to help you find other IoT enthusiasts in your area.

## Visual Assets
* Feel free to use one of the templates in [[this folder| ]] to create your logo, banners, social media graphics etc. We recommend using [canva](https://www.canva.com/), it's free to use and they have pre-sized templates you can use to drop our graphics into or make your own.

## Promotion plan + Email and Communication 
* Check out our social media and email templates which will help you share your event and make sure you get the important details across.
